#LAP 1 PROJECT - GUESS THE PAINTING'S AUTHOR

##Description

###The Hive group of secondary schools' management team has observed a decline in engagement with non-STEM subjects over the past two years. In response, we are developing a game focused on the Arts subject, where students are challenged to guess the author of a zoomed-in picture. This interactive and educational game aims to foster interest and knowledge in the field of Arts among students.
